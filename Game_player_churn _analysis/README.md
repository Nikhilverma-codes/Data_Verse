# Game Player Churn Prediction ðŸŽ®ðŸ”¥

This project predicts whether a player will churn from a game based on their in-game behavior using:

- Decision Tree Classifier ðŸŒ³
- XGBoost Classifier ðŸš€

## Dataset
The dataset contains features like:
- Total timestamps
- Unique days
- Max level
- Playing density
- Etc.

## Models Used
- Decision Tree
- XGBoost

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy on both models.
- XGBoost performed robustly with less overfitting.

## How to Run
1. Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Open notebook: jupyter notebook notebook/churn-analysis.ipynb
