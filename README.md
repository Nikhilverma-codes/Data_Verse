# 🌍 data_verse - My Data Science Journey 🚀  

Welcome to **data_verse**! This repository is a collection of my **data science projects**, where I explore different datasets, perform analysis, and create visualizations.  

## 📌 Projects  
### 1️⃣ California Housing Analysis 🏡  
**Description:**  
- Explored **California Housing Dataset** using **Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib**.  
- Performed data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualized key trends.  
- **Key Insight:** Housing prices are strongly linked to median income.

### 2️⃣ Salary Prediction Project 💼  
**Description:**  
- Built a **Linear Regression** model using **scikit-learn** to predict salaries.  
- Dataset includes features like **experience, education, age, gender, and job title**.  
- Explored multivariable regression and evaluated model performance.

### 3️⃣ Bank Subscription Classifier 🏦  
**Description:**
- Built a **Logistic Regression** model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.
- Preprocessed the data, handled **class imbalance** using upsampling, and evaluated with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Key Insight**: Balanced models perform better in identifying both subscribing and non-subscribing clients.

### 4️⃣ Game Player Churn Classifier 🎮🔥  
**Description:**  
- Predicted **player churn** based on behavioral data from an online game.  
- Built models using **Decision Tree** and **XGBoost** classifiers.  
- Performed EDA, feature scaling, and handled class labels effectively.  
- Achieved **perfect accuracy** (only possible due to dataset bias or imbalance—subject to further review).  
- **Key Insight:** Features like **max level**, **unique active days**, and **average play density** strongly indicate likelihood of churn.

### 📂 Future Projects  
I’ll keep adding more projects on topics like **EDA, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization**! Stay tuned. 🚀
