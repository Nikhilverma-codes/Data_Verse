# Salary Prediction Project

This project demonstrates a simple **Linear Regression** model to predict salaries based on years of experience, age, education level, gender, job title. It's ideal for beginners in Data Science who are starting to explore supervised machine learning.

## 📁 Files Included

- **Salary Prediction Project.ipynb** — Jupyter notebook with the full code (data loading, visualization, model training, and evaluation).
- **Salary Data.xlsx** — Dataset containing years of experience and corresponding salaries.


## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

### 📊 Dataset

The dataset (`Salary Data.xlsx`) contains the following columns:

- YearsExperience
- EducationLevel
- Age
- Gender
- Salary
- JobTitle

It is a multivariable dataset used for supervised learning. These features are used to train a regression model to predict salary based on a combination of demographic and professional attributes.

## 🔍 What This Project Covers

- Loading and preprocessing data
- Handling categorical variables 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Training a **Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`
- Making predictions
- Visualizing results and feature relationships

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project folder.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook (`Salary_Prediction_Project.ipynb`).
3. Run the cells to execute the entire flow from data loading to prediction.

## 📈 Sample Output

The model estimates salary based on various factors and shows how multiple features influence salary predictions.
